Task 1 Insights:
- These top 5 people make up a very large portion of total revenue
- Jacob, Ethan, Sophia, Lucas, Emma are the 5 biggest spenders (respectively).
- These are not completely realized revenue orders, this includes cancelled orders
- The inclusion of cancelled order could show us how much these people are spending and would spend if not for reason of cancelling. Targeting why the orders are cancelled by either end could sift out and issues or problems with the purchasing or selling process.


Task 2 Insights:
- Electronics is the highest grossing category
- Sharp contrast between money made between categories which could possibly
indicate either want for products or product prices (higher-priced or higher order volume)
- You can use this information to help ddetermine pricing, in the sense that there could be lots of order and low relative revenue, meaning underpriced items, or vice versa.


Task 3 Insights:
- This is a good way to show the salary structure of a department by comparing highest paid individual and average made.
- If there is a large gap it could implicate that there is a big disparity between salary and could either be a bad thing that implicates unfair pay, or people in a specialized role in that department.
- The departments with the biggest difference is sales and IT, with IT requiring specified roles and sales may be because it could also be comission based.


Task 4 Insights:
- The only city with gold status is Tampa
- This would mean for the business that they have targeted Tampa real well, and other insights need to be made into which cities are undertargeted so that the business could increase reach and sales.
